# NuCLS Dataset Organization

This repository contains the organized NuCLS dataset, which is a large-scale dataset for nucleus classification, localization, and segmentation in breast cancer. The dataset has been preprocessed and organized into `train`, `test`, and `val` folders, with separate subfolders for `rgb`, `annotation`, and `mask` data. Additionally, the dataset is further organized for two primary tasks: **Object Detection** and **Semantic Segmentation**.

## Dataset Overview

The NuCLS dataset contains over 220,000 labeled nuclei from breast cancer images from TCGA. The nuclei were annotated by pathologists, pathology residents, and medical students.

## Dataset Details

**Source:** [NuCLS Website](https://sites.google.com/view/nucls/home)

### Structure of the Original Dataset

Each dataset folder includes four sub-folders:
- **rgb:** FOV images (`.png`)
- **csv:** Annotation coordinates (`.csv`)
- **mask:** Mask images (`.png`)
- **visualization:** Visualization images (`.png`)

**Image Resolution:** All images are at 0.2 microns-per-pixel.  
**Coordinate Units:** Pixel units at 0.2 microns-per-pixel.

### CSV Annotation File

Each CSV file includes:
- `raw_classification`: Raw cell type (13 total)
- `main_classification`: Nucleus class (7 total)
- `super_classification`: Nucleus superclass (4 total)
- `type`: Annotation type (`rectangle` or `polyline`)
- `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`: Bounding box coordinates
- `coords_x`, `coords_y`: Comma-separated polygon boundary coordinates

### Mask Format

- **First channel:** Encodes class labels.
- **Second and third channels:** Their product provides the unique instance label.
- **FOV area:** Represented in gray and included in the class table.

**Note:** Unlike the CSV files, the mask images do not differentiate between bounding boxes and segmentations.


### Key Features
- **13 Cell Types**: Includes tumor, fibroblast, lymphocyte, macrophage, and more.
- **Annotation Types**: Rectangular bounding boxes and polyline masks.
- **Tasks Supported**: Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation.

## Dataset Selection and Organization Workflow

### Dataset Selection
The NuCLS dataset provides both **single-rater** and **multi-rater** datasets. For this project:
- **Single-Rater Dataset**: Selected for consistency in annotations.
- **Corrected Single-Rater Dataset**: Chosen to ensure high-quality annotations.
- **Train-Test Split**: Used **folder-1** from the train-test split folder, which includes `fold_1_train.csv` and `fold_1_test.csv`.

### Step 1: Organizing RGB, Annotation, and Mask Folders Based on CSV Files
The dataset was initially organized using the `fold_1_train.csv` and `fold_1_test.csv` files. These CSV files were used to match and organize the `rgb`, `annotation`, and `mask` folders into `train`, `test`, and `val` sets.

The code for this step is available in the file:  
ðŸ“„ **`data.py`**

After organizing the dataset based on the CSV files, the dataset was structured into `train`, `test`, and `val` folders. Each folder contains the following subfolders:
- **rgb**: Contains the RGB images.
- **annotation**: Contains CSV files with nucleus annotations.
- **mask**: Contains mask images for semantic segmentation.

The folder structure is as follows:

```plaintext
train/
â”œâ”€â”€ rgb/
â”œâ”€â”€ annotation/
â””â”€â”€ mask/
test/
â”œâ”€â”€ rgb/
â”œâ”€â”€ annotation/
â””â”€â”€ mask/
val/
â”œâ”€â”€ rgb/
â”œâ”€â”€ annotation/
â””â”€â”€ mask/
```


### Step 2: Organizing for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation
The dataset was further organized into two tasks:
1. **Object Detection**: Contains cropped images for nuclei with rectangular annotations. No masks are provided for this task.
2. **Semantic Segmentation**: Contains cropped images and corresponding masks for nuclei with polyline annotations.

The folder structure for these tasks is as follows:

```plaintext
main_organised/
â”œâ”€â”€ object_detection/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tumor/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/  # Cropped nuclei (rectangles)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fibroblast/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚   ...
â””â”€â”€ semantic_segmentation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tumor/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/  # Cropped nuclei
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ masks/   # Binary polygon masks (0: background, 255: nucleus)
    â”œâ”€â”€ fibroblast/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ masks/
    ...

```

The code for this step is available in the file:  
ðŸ“„ **`organise_main.py`**

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandana-koganti14/NuCLS-Dataset-Organization.git
cd NuCLS-Dataset-Organization
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pillow tqdm
```

### 3. Organize the Dataset

Update the paths in data.py to match your local directory structure. For example:

- **csv_file**: Path to fold_1_train.csv or fold_1_test.csv.
- **rgb_folder**: Path to the folder containing RGB images.
- **annotation_folder**: Path to the folder containing annotation CSV files.
- **mask_folder**: Path to the folder containing mask images.
- **output_folder**: Path to the output folder (e.g., train or test).

```bash
python data.py
```

Update the paths in organise_main.py to match your local directory structure. For example:

- **image_dir**: Path to the rgb folder.
- **mask_dir**: Path to the mask folder.
- **annotation_dir**: Path to the annotation folder.
- **output_dir**: Path to the output folder for organized data.

```bash
python organise_main.py
```

## Code Files

The dataset was organized using the following Python scripts:
- ðŸ“„ **`data.py`**: Organizes `rgb`, `annotation`, and `mask` folders based on CSV files.
- ðŸ“„ **`organise_main.py`**: Further organizes the dataset for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation.

---

**Additional Notes:**
   - Rectangular masks in some cases output entirely white images. Therefore, two separate datasets (rectangular and polyline) were created to serve object detection and semantic segmentation tasks respectively.
   - A `README.txt` is generated in the output folder summarizing the number of images per tissue type for each task.
